## Context and Objective
Tabletop roleplaying is an amazing opportunity for its participants to explore the limits of their imagination, whatever their background. Who better to display this ability than children to, with their uninhibited worldview, to participate and improve this process.

But there's a problem. The rules used by most systems is often too complex to keep children interested and involved. With complicated calculations, and required upfront preparation work, getting children to enjoy the game is at risk.

Cory Doctorow, in [Issue 1 of Gygax Magazine](http://gygaxmagazine.com/selected-content/dming-for-your-toddler/), explained this situation, and offered an alternative path that still introduces the concepts used in more mature game systems, but in a way that allows children to feel they are properly involved in the process.

This guide is an effort to further flesh out this idea and provide parents with the basis for a fun, immersive, and, most importantly, accessible way to encourage children to play out their adventures without turning this into a chore.
